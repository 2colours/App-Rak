App::Rak - a CLI for searching strings in files

SYNOPSIS
========

```bash
$ rak foo      # look for "foo" in current directory recursively

$ rak foo bar  # look for "foo" in directory "bar" recursively

$ rak '/ << foo >> /'    # look for "foo" as word in current directory

$ raku foo --files-only  # look for "foo", only produce filenames

$ raku foo --before=2 --after=2  # also produce 2 lines before and after
```

DESCRIPTION
===========

App::Rak provides a CLI called `rak` that allows you to look for a needle in (a selection of files) from a given directory recursively.

Note: this is still very much in alpha development phase. Comments and suggestions are more than welcome!
