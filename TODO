Ideas / Todo's
==============

- run a raku program and interpret the execution error as an --edit
- expose mapper functionality
- create plugin structure
- modify files met csv-per-line
- XPath en XML file support
- support for timezones, selecting on name, but also on properties
- some form if binary support
- search spesh log
- watch file support
- add --tar=name option to create tar-file from files with matches
- add --gist=title option to save search result
- now that we have ngram, perhaps allow for some fuzzy searching?
- support for spreadsheets
- support for colors a la ack
- make use of --type leading: --type=contains would force any pattern to
  be considered literally, rather than trying to interpret for regexes or
  code.  This would make --type=auto the default (trying to interpret).
  Other types could be --type=regex and --type=code to interpret the pattern
  as a regex or as code respectively, without the /.../ or {...} checks.
  And possibly in the future: --type=json-path for the 'jp:' prefix to
  interprete the rest of the pattern as a JSON::Path specification.

Errors
======
If a file is under version control, it does not mean it actually contains
text.  Need to fix that with --blame-per-file/line.

--find * does not seem to expand all paths in current dir

--proximate functionality needs to check absolute distances, as with
--backtrace line numbers *can* go backwards
