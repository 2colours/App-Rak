Ideas / Todo's
==============

- run a raku program and interpret the execution error as an --edit
- expose mapper functionality
- create plugin structure
- modify files met csv-per-line
- support for timezones, selecting on name, but also on properties
- some form if binary support
- search spesh log
- watch file support
- add --tar=name option to create tar-file from files with matches
- add --gist=title option to save search result
- now that we have ngram, perhaps allow for some fuzzy searching?
- support for spreadsheets
- support for colors a la ack
- add support for --type=json-path for the 'jp:' prefix to interpret
  the rest of the pattern as a JSON::Path specification.
- XPath en XML file support
- add Log::Timeline support somehow
- Allow for hypering withing a file if the file is larger than X bytes
  (probably 1MB)
- Implement a --smartmark flag: --ignoremark if pattern contains any
  non-base characters.

Errors
======
If a file is under version control, it does not mean it actually contains
text.  Need to fix that with --blame-per-file/line.

--find * does not seem to expand all paths in current dir

--proximate functionality needs to check absolute distances, as with
--backtrace line numbers *can* go backwards
