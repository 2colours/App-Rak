Q: How can I limit to files with a certain extension?
A: Use "--extensions=name" where "name" is the actual extension.  Note that
   a period will be added for the actual comparisons.

Q: How can I limit to files without extension?
A: Use "--extensions=,".  This works because the comma is used to indicate
   multiple extensions to accept.  In this case, since there are no letters
   between the "=" and the ",", it specifies a zero character extension.
