Listing modifiers:
‒‒‒‒‒‒‒‒‒‒‒‒‒‒‒‒‒‒

--absolute

Indicate that whenever a path is shown, it should be shown as an absolute
path.  The default is False, making paths show as relative paths.

--break[=string]

String to show between different files.  Defaults to "" if a human is
watching, or to no string to show between different files otherwise.

--file-separator-null

Only makes sense in combination with --files-with-matches or
--files-without-matches.  If specified, will separate filenames
with null bytes, rather than with newlines.  Defaults to False.

--group-matches

If specified with a true value, then if a file contains matches, will
show the filename on a separate line, otherwise the filename will be
prefixed to any match.  Defaults to True if a human is watching, else
False.

--highlight

Highlight matches in strings if the pattern is not a Callable.
Defaults to True if a human is watching, else False.

--highlight-before=xxx

Specify the string to put before a match in a string.  By default
is the BOLD ON terminal sequence.

 --highlight-after=yyy

Specify the string to put after a match in a string.  Defaults to
either what was specified with --highlight-before, or to BOLD OFF
if that was *not* specified.

--human

Force defaults as if a human is watching.  Defaults to True if a human
is watching (aka, a terminal is connected to STDOUT, aka $*OUT.t is true).
The following defaults will be applied unless specifically overridden:

 --break=""
 --group-matches
 --highlight
 --trim
 --only-first=1000
 --proximate=1

--only-first[=N]

Specify the *total* number of lines that matched, to be shown.  Defaults
to 1000 if a human is watching, else no limitation will be applied.  If
specified as a flag, assumes 1.

--output-file=filename

Specify the name of the file to send the output to.  Defaults to STDOUT.

--pager=program

Specify a pager program to use.  Defaults to what is specified with the
ACK_PAGER environment variable.  If that is not specified either, does
not activate any pager.

--proximate[=N]

Specify grouping of matched lines by indicating the maximum difference
in line number value that is allowed before an extra empty line will
be added between matches.  Defaults to 1 if a human is watching, or
no proximation otherwise.

--show-blame

Indicate whether to show blame information if possible (currently only
"git blame" supported).  Defaults to False.

--show-item-number

Indicate whether to show the item number of an item that matched.
Defaults to True.  Some other options may override this, such as
--unique and --frequencies.

--show-filename

Indicate whether to show the filename in which a match occurred.
Defaults to True.  Some other options may override this, such as
--unique and --frequencies.

--summary-if-larger-than=N

Indicate whether a matching line should be summarized if it
exceeds the given number of characters.  Defaults to 160.

--stats

Indicate to show statistics about the search performed after the
results have been shown.  Defaults to False.

--trim

Indicate to remove whitespace at the start and the end of a
matching line.  Defaults to True if a human is watching.  May be
overridden by some options, such as --context.
