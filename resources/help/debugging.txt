Debugging options:
‒‒‒‒‒‒‒‒‒‒‒‒‒‒‒‒‒‒

--dont-catch

Indicate that code exceptions should be thrown with Raku backtrace.
Defaults to False, catching any exception and turn this into a
limited error message.  Mostly intended for App::Rak developers
and for error reporting by users when making a Github issue.

--list-expanded-options

If specified with a True value, do not execute search query.
Instead show all the options that would be executed internally
after all custom options (previously saved with --save) have been
expanded.  Defaults to False, performing the query as intended.
Mostly intended for users that don't understand the presented
results from the given arguments, and potentially for error
reporting by users when making a Github issue.

--list-known-extensions

If specified with a True value, will list all of the extension
groups known, and which extensions are considered part or that
group.  No other arguments should be specified.  Mainly intended
as documentation for both users as well as App::Rak developers.

--rak

If specified with a True value, will show the arguments that will
be passed to the "rak" plumbing logic.  Intended to be used by
App::Rak developers.  Defaults to False, not showing these arguments.
