--checkout=string

Helper function for the busy developer who has a large number of
git branches to handle.  Takes the specified string, searches the
available branches in the current directory, and will checkout
the one if there is a single match.  Presents the matching branches
if there is more than one.  Will checkout branch "main" if "master"
was specified if there is no branch named "master", and vice-versa.
Branches need not have been checked out locally yet.

EDITOR environment variable.  If no editor specification can be
found, will assume "vim" as the editor.

Can be used in conjuction with --find to edit files of which the
name matches the pattern.

--vimgrep

Take the search result as positiuons in the code to go edit from
within "vim" using the :vimgrep option.
