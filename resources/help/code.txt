--module=foo

Indicate the Raku module to be loaded before compiling Raku
code pattern.  Can be specfied more than once.  Defaults to
no additional module loading.  Also known as -M when calling
Raku itself.

Example:
# show all non-empty lines as space separated codepoints
# using the experimental "pack" function
$ rak --module='experimental :pack' '{ (pack "A*", $_).List }'

--quietly

Indicate whether warnings should be disabled when executing
a Callable pattern.  Defaults to False.

--repository=lib

Indicate the directory of a filesystem repository that should
be used first to look for module loading.  Defaults to no
additional repositories.  Also known as -I when calling Raku
itself.

--silently[=out,err]

Indicate whether any output that is created by executing a
Callable pattern, should be prevented from actually being
shown.  If specified as a flag, will capture both STDOUT
and STDERR.  Can also specifically capture STDOUT (with
"out") and/or capture STDERR (with "err").  Defaults to
no preventing any output from a Callable pattern.
